genesis v2.8.9 (614c9727d4) build 20221221.064230
USAGE: genesis do <options> env-name[.yml] action [args ...]

OPTIONS
  -h, --help        Show this help screen.

      --[no]-color  Enable [or disable] color output

  -q, --quiet       Suppress informative output (errors will still be displayed)

  -D, --debug       Enable debugging, printing helpful message about what
                    Genesis is doing, to standard error.

  -T, --trace       Even more debugging, including debugging inside called
                    tools (like spruce and bosh).  Any trace commands within
                    the Genesis codebase will be printed, along with identifying
                    the line they were encountered.

  -S, --show-stack  Will show stack trace when displaying fatal error due to
                    runtime conditions or bugs.  When -T|--trace is also
                    specified, each trace will contain the full stack of where
                    it was encountered.

  -C, --cwd         Effective working directory.  You can also specify the
                    environment YAML file to use, in which case the working
                    directory is the one containing the specified file.
                    Defaults to '.'

  -e, --bosh-env    Which BOSH environment (aka director) to use.  If not
                    specified, it will use the value in genesis.bosh or
                    genesis.env in that order.  Can also be provided using
                    either $GENESIS_BOSH_ENVIRONMENT env variables.

                    As of v2.8.0, the BOSH director information is read from
                    Exodus data instead of the local .bosh/config, and as such,
                    expect the deployment type of the bosh director to be
                    'bosh'.  If this is not the case, you can specify the
                    deployment type after the deployment name, separated by a
                    '/' (ie c-aws-myenv/new-bosh).  This will inform the system
                    where to find the Exodus data.

  -c, --config <s>  Specify a YAML file to be used as a config instead of
                    fetching it from the BOSH director.  This option can be
                    specified multiple times for different configurations.
                    The syntax for specifying the config is:

                    [<type>[@<name>]=]<path>

                    The type defaults to 'cloud', and name defaults to 'default'
                    if not given.  In this way, it maintains its backwards
                    compatibility of the original `-c` option for specifying
                    the cloud config file.

  --cloud-config    Specify a local YAML file to use at the cloud config.  If
                    not specified but needed, it will be fetched from the BOSH
                    director. (Shortform: --cc)

                    This is deprecated: use -c|--config <path> instead.

  --runtime-config  Specify a local YAML file to use at the runtime config.  If
                    not specified but needed, it will be fetched from the BOSH
                    director. (Shortform: --rc)

                    This is deprecated: use -c|--config runtime=<path> instead.
